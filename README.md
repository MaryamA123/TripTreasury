# Trip Treasury 

The primary goal of our project is to develop a user-friendly and intuitive
website that enables holidaygoers to easily convert currencies and plan
their budgets for their trips. We aim to create a comprehensive and
efficient platform that simplifies the process of managing finances whilst
travelling.
